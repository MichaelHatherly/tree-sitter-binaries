This repository provides build scripts for
[tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) parsers based on
Julia's [BinaryBuilder.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder.jl)
package as well as the compiled libraries for each parser. Scripts will be
upstreamed to the community build repository,
[Yggdrasil](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil), once they have
matured.
